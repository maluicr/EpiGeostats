# blockdss

blockdss R package generates geostatistical disease maps using block direct sequential simulation algorithm.

It is designed to create disease rate maps with associated spatial uncertainty, but may also be used for similar problems such as mortality rates, or applied to other fields like ecology or criminology. Details on the geostatistical algorithm used in blockdss are described in Azevedo et al^[https://doi.org/10.1186/s12942-020-00221-5].

# R wrapper

blockdss R package is a wrapper for running dss.c.64.exe - a software tool for running geostatistical algorithms - and pixelate, an R package for creating geostatistical maps with varying pixel sizes to represent disease mapping and spatial uncertainty in a single-map.

This package provides convenient wrappers to write data frames in format readable by dss.c.64.exe (geoEAS), setting the required parameters, running block direct sequential simulation algorithm, reading the files generated by dss.c.64.exe, and pixelate spatially continuous predictions as per their average uncertainty.

# Getting started

1. download dss.c.64.exe from https://github.com/maluicr/dss (follow the download instructions)
2. install required packages using the following code (please accept any suggested package updates): 

```r
# install devtools from CRAN
if (!require("devtools")){
  install.packages("devtools")
  }
  
  # install packages from GitHub
  devtools::install_github("maluicr/blockdss", build_vignettes = TRUE, upgrade_dependencies = FALSE)
  devtools::install_github("aimeertaylor/pixelate", build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE)
```

# Example

As an example, blockdss is used to map covid-19 incidence in Portugal on 15 January 2021. After installation of packages and dss.c.64.exe, load the package and follow the example as presented in vignette :

```r
# load blockdss 
library(blockdss)

# see documentation on blockdss
help(package = "blockdss")
```
