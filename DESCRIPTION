Description: The package provides functions to configure a file with parameters and arguments needed to invoke dss.c.64.exe and run block simulation program. The package is suited for disease mapping as it estimates population-weighted variograms in the kriging process. In a last step, geostatistical simulations, median and uncertainty disease risk maps are obtained.
