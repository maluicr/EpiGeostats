Description: The package provides simple syntax for disease risk mapping with geostatistical simulations. Highly-resolved maps of median disease risk and associated uncertainty are derived. A single-map combining both elements can be extracted and plotted. Runs block direct sequential simulation algortihm and uses population-weighted semi-variogram functions to solve the block kriging equations.
