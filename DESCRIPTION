Description: The packages provides functions to configure a file with parameters and arguments needed to invoke dss.c.64.exe.
              Run block direct sequential simulation algortihm. The package is suited for disease mapping as 
              it estimates population-weighted variograms in the kriging process. 
              In a last step, geostatistical simulations, median and uncertainty disease risk maps are obtained.
              A pixelated single-map combining median and associated interquartile range risks is available.
