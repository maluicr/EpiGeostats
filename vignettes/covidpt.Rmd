## 1 Introduction

This tutorial shows how to run block sequential simulation with R to model the spatial distribution of a disease, as in Azevedo et al. 2020^[https://doi.org/10.1186/s12942-020-00221-5]. For that purpose we will follow an example using COVID-19 data where simulated risk maps, median risk map and risk uncertainty map are obtained in the end.

The R code in this tutorial calculates parameters and generate files to be read by an .exe program (dss.c.64.exe) performing block sequential simulation (using direct sequential simulation algorithm, Soares 2000^[https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1012246006212]).

## 2 Data and R code

A set of functions written in R will generate the required files and call dss.c.64.exe for block sequential simulation.

To run the code, you will need :

- a COVID-19 datafile and,
- a georeferenced grid with id region values at all simulation locations.

## 3 Basic instructions

Make sure to put all data and R functions in default (working) directory. Inside that directory create a folder called `input` and put the dss.c.64.exe inside.

## 4 COVID-19 example

For our example we will use a COVID-19 dataset for Portugal mainland with all cases notified to health authorities on 01/06/2020. The example is a step-by-step guide to obtain simulated risk maps of COVID-19, median risk map and risk uncertainty map. All tools needed - R functions, datasets and .exe - are available on github to reproduce example.

### 4.1 Source functions

Start by running the code via source. I created separate files for each function:
```{r source-files, echo = T, results='hide'}
source("f1_irates.R", echo = T)
source("f2_blockfile.R", echo = T)
source("f3_maskfile.R", echo = T)
source("f4_varexp.R", echo = T)
source("f5_varmodel.R", echo = T)
source("f6_ssdpars.R", echo = T)
source("f7_outraster.R", echo = T)
```

### 4.2 Import COVID-19 data

As input you should provide a data frame with id of region, x, y and z cartesian coordinates at region mass center, number of COVID-19 cases by region and population at risk by region. 

Therefore we start by reading an ascii file with the COVID-19 data (available on github) and create a data frame from it.

```{r covid-data}
covid = read.table("covid19_data.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", dec = ".")
```

```{r covid-data2}
head(covid)
str(covid)
```
You may see the dataset contains regions where number of cases are missing (id regions 3 and 4). These NA must be replaced by an integer, for kriging to run. Function `irates()` (next section) includes an argument to overcome this limitation. 

### 4.3 Compute rates (/10^4) and variance-error terms with `irates()`

Syntax:
```{r, echo = F}
str(args(irates))
```

Use `irates()` to compute rates (/10^4), variance-error terms by region.
The arguments of the function are:

- `dfobj`, string, dataframe name with COVID-19 data
- `oid`, character, field name for region id
- `xx`, character, field name for x-coordinates 
- `yy`, character, field name for y-coordinates 
- `zz`, character, field name for z-coordinates 
- `cases`, character, field name for number of cases 
- `pop`, character, field name for population size
- `casesNA`, numeric, an integer used to replace rows with cases = NA,
- `day`, character, string indicating date (format "yyyymmdd") of COVID-19 data

```{r rates-var}
rates = irates(dfobj = covid, oid = "id_region", xx = "xcoord", yy = "ycoord", zz = "zcoord", 
               cases = "ncases", pop = "poprisk", casesNA = 2, day = "20200601")
```

The function `irates()` returns the following list of objects:
```{r rates-var-return}
str(rates)
```

It also writes a text file (.out) with rates and store it in `input` folder. 

### 4.4 Create block data with `blockfile()`

Syntax:
```{r, echo = F}
str(args(blockfile))
```

Use `blockfile()` to transform grid file in block format. The function requires some libraries to be loaded. If not installed they will be first installed.

You should provide a georeferenced grid file with id region values at simulation locations.
The arguments of the function are:

- `rateobj`, string, name of list, output of function `irates()`. 
- `gridimage`, character,  name of georeferenced grid file (e.g. tif) 
- `na.value`, numeric, integer with grid value for "No data"  

```{r block-data, warning = F, message = F}
block = blockfile(rates, "grid2k.tif")
```

The grid file values should refer to the region id's at simulation locations (nodes). All regions in covid data should be represented by 1 or more node. 

The function writes a text file (.out) with blockdata and store it in `input` folder. `blockfile()` also returns the following list of objects:

```{r block-data-return}
str(block, max.level = 2)
```

### 4.5 Create mask file with `maskfile()`

Syntax:
```{r, echo = F}
str(args(maskfile))
```

The function `maskfile()` creates a mask for the block file. The only argument of the function is the name of list, output of function `blockfile()`.

```{r mask-file}
mask = maskfile(block)
```

Generates a file with values {-1,0} where -1 are assigned to nodata locations and 0 are assigned to nodes with values (id region). A text file (.out) with mask data is created and stored in `input` folder.

```{r mask-file-return}
str(mask)
```

### 4.6 Calculate experimental variogram with `varexp()`

Syntax:
```{r, echo = F}
str(args(varexp))
```

Use `varexp()` to calculate experimental variogram from COVID-19 rates.
Only implemented in omnidirectional case.
The arguments are:

- `dfobj`, string, name of list, output of function `irates()`
- `lag`, numeric, the lag distance used for variogram estimates 
- `nlags`, numeric, the number of lags to calculate variogram.

```{r varexp}
vexp = varexp(rates, lag = 7000, nlags = 15)
```

The function returns a list with the weighted variance (by population size) and variogram estimates at nlags.

```{r varexp-str}
str(vexp)
```

You may plot results to evaluate main structural patterns in the data:
```{r varexp-plot}
plot(vexp[["semivar"]], ylab = expression(paste(gamma, "(h)")), xlab = "h (in m)") 
```

### 4.7 Fit variogram model with `varmodel()`

Syntax:
```{r, echo = F}
str(args(varmodel))
```

Funtion `varmodel()` fits (manually) a theoretical variogram. You should provide the experimental variogram data to evaluate fit by visual inspection, the variogram model type and the variogram parameters.
The arguments of `varmodel()` are:

- `varexp`, string, name of object, output of function varexp() 
- `mod`, character, the variogram model type (available are: "Sph" or "Exp")
- `nug`, numeric, nugget-effect value of the variogram
- `ran`, numeric, range value of the variogram
- `sill`, numeric, sill (or partial sill) value of the variogram

```{r varmodel}
vmod = varmodel(vexp, mod = "Exp", nug = 0, ran = 60000, sill = vexp[["weightsvar"]])
```

```{r varmodel-str}
str(vmod)
```

```{r varmodel-plot}
# plot experimental variogram
plot(vexp[["semivar"]], ylab = expression(paste(gamma, "(h)")), xlab = "h (in m)") 
# add sill
abline(h = vexp[["weightsvar"]], col ="red", lty = 2)
# add theoretical model
lines(vmod[["fittedval"]]) 
```

### 4.8 Create parameters file with `ssdpars()` and calls dss.c.64.exe

Syntax:
```{r, echo = F}
str(args(ssdpars))
```

Function `ssdpars()` writes the parameters file (.par) for .exe and runs block sequential simulations
Function arguments are the names of objects returned above and parameter values for block-kriging and simulation processes: 

- `blockobj`, string, name of list, output of function blockfile()
- `maskobj`, string, name of list, output of function maskfile()
- `dfobj`, string, name of list, output of function irates()
- `varmobj`, string, name of list, output of function varmodel()
- `simulations`, numeric, number of simulations
- `nrbias`, numeric, nr simulations for bias correction
- `biascor`, num vector, flag for (mean, variance) correction (yes = 1, no = 0)
- `ndMin`, numeric, min number of neighbour observations used in  kriging
- `ndMax`, numeric, max number of neighbour observations used in  kriging
- `nodMax`, numeric, max number of previously simulated nodes used in  kriging
- `radius1`, numeric, search radii in the major horizontal axe
- `radius2`, numeric, search radii in the axe orthogonal (horizontal) to radius1
- `radius3`, numeric, search radii in the vertical axe
- `ktype`, numeric, the kriging type to be used (available are: 0 = simple, 1 = ordinary)

```{r ssdir, eval = F}
ssdpars(blockobj = block, maskobj = mask, dfobj = rates, varmobj = vmod, 
        simulations = 5, radius1 = 60000, radius2 = 60000)
```

The function generates a text file (.par), calls dss.c.64.exe, run block simulations and returns the simulated maps (.out). This process may take a while depending mostly on the number of simulation nodes and  number of simulations. 

Both text file (.par) and simulations files (.out) are stored in `input` folder.

### 4.9 Obtain risk maps with `outraster()`.

Syntax:
```{r, echo = F}
str(args(outraster))
```

Function `outraster()` read simulation files (.out) returned by `ssdpars()` and returns a list with simulated maps (rasterstack object), e-type and uncertainty maps (rasterlayers). 

The arguments of the function:

- `blockobj`, string,  name of list, output of function `blockfile()`,
- if `grids = T`,  saves simulated maps in 'native' raster package format .grd,
- if `emaps = T` (default), saves e-type and uncertainty maps in format .grd.

All .grd (and respective .gri) files are stored in `input` folder.
```{r outraster}
maps = outraster(block)
```

```{r str}
str(maps, max.level = 3)
```
You may plot results:
```{r spplot sims }
spplot(maps[["simulations"]])
```

```{r spplot etype}
spplot(maps[["etype"]])
```

```{r spplot uncert}
spplot(maps[["uncertainty"]])
```
